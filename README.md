# Selective Pausable

An expansion on OpenZeppelin's Pausable.sol contract, which adds the ability to pause/unpause a function by
its selector.

This contract can work instead of, or along side the OpenZeppelin Pausable.sol contract.

This contract is in development and should only be used after performing independent testing.

Install with: `npm i selective-pausable`
